# The CS1010 I/O Library

To help students get started with C programming without worrying too much about the details and pitfalls of using `printf` and `scanf`, CS1010 provides a simple-to-use library to read and write integers, floating point numbers, and strings.

For documentation and usage of the library, please check out the [module website](https://nus-cs1010.github.io/1819-s1/library.html).
